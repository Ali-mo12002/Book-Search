### Google Books Search App

## Description
The Google Books Search App allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can create an account, log in, and save their favorite books to a personal list. This app demonstrates the use of a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) architecture with GraphQL for API queries and mutations.
